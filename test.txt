**Stars above, and the blade between**

            
Stars scatter across the sky on this night. I've watched the same scenery time and time again, but for just this once I felt particularly uneased. "Truly, is this what must be done for our people? For Etrea?" I mumble to myself, clutching my blade in hand. "Each star has a story," I remember my old companion told me upon nights similar to these. Her words echo through my head as I gaze upon this sky, although it is not the same. Upon this field, I sit without her now, as grass waves across the field with the night-touched wind. "You're too sentimental, Rali," I'd often reply to her, unamused by those fairy tales. After all this time though, I suppose she was right. The stars above speak more to me now than ever before, and for each gleaming light in the sky, I know there must be a being above, watching us. An audience I'll never see, but cherish nonetheless.
"Tavi!" A man calls out to me, though I am too entranced to notice at first. "Tavi! Tavi Ytreshi! Wake up! Sire?" He calls out once more, and I'm shaken out of my trance abruptly. I look over to the voice, and recognize A'ras. "Huh? What do you need at this hour, A'ras? The stars are already out." I reply, looking up at him with a confused expression. The man flashes a wide grin, evidently he had just finished some sort of mischievous activity. "The King requires us. One last meeting, I promise. Then, we're off to bed for the voyage tomorrow," A'ras said in a cheerful tone. I still cannot understand how a man of such renown can remain so carefree, despite the battles he's fought. A'ras looks over to my hand, eying it carefully. "Quite a blade there, Tavi. What could you be doing with a weapon in such a serene place?" He chuckles as he gestures toward the Queensblade. "...Just appreciating fine craftsmanship, is all. You needn't worry about such frivolities." I quickly reply, although too quickly to a fault, perhaps. I don't want to raise suspicion, especially tonight of all nights. A'ras shrugs, chuckling. "How charming. Now then, enough niceties, we have a meeting to attend... at this dreadful hour." He pulls me up off the grass, though I struggle to gather my balance for a moment. "S'pose I've sat here for a while." I mumble to myself, standing up on my feet. "Let's get going then." A'ras spoke hastily, dragging me along to the royal palace.
Dimly lit candles stretch across the halls of the Etrean palace, I observe as my fellow attendants walk toward the throne room, each man's armor clanking with each step. The carpet below my feet must be more expensive than my life's worth, so much so I almost feel bad for dirtying it with my soil-tainted boots. As we continue through the hall, servants quickly scramble to clean the mess our footprints left behind. "It's a shame this is the life they're destined to live," one of my fellow attendants discusses amidst our group. Destiny, they say... only a fool would consider their life already foretold. I glance at my 'ally', and contain a chuckle quiet enough to myself. Four of us, myself included, will be entrusted to protecting the king upon his royal voyage tomorrow. Our destination is Markor, one of the capital cities of the Central Luminant. "The king has politics to deal with," is the simplified version of what we've been told. The details are not meant for us lowly guards, the last thing they want is us forming our own opinions on the matter. A loud knock echoes throughout the halls, as we reach the door to the throne room. "Men, here's to a quick meeting. Pray," A'ras jests, before opening the door to the royal chamber.
A large chandelier hangs overhead above the King of Etrea, surrounded by paintings depicting events of our history, and a large window overhead the throne. Royal palace guards line the walls in an orderly fashion, evidently a formation in the king's tastes. "So the Four Braves finally arrive," the king muses. I lower my head, and kneel. The rest of my men follow. "Your highness, what requires our presence at such an hour?" A'ras asks politely, lowering his head as he finishes his sentence. The king laughs, amused by the question as if it was obvious. It's not. "Oh, my boy, I simply wanted to ensure you're all still living for our arrangement tomorrow! At dawn, we depart for Markor. Red prepared us a beauty of a vessel... the Brave Hoshi, she calls it! What a lovely name!" He lets out a hearty laugh, the likes of which make me sick to my stomach. How can a man so foul appear so calm? Does he not have any regrets for what he's done? I feel myself gripping my knee in frustration, before catching myself and exhaling. Calm. I need to remain calm for what lies ahead. "Your highness," I begin to inquire, "Are there private quarters on the ship for our voyage? It shall be a long week, I hope we may sleep soundly upon the harsh waves of Markor waters." The king nods with a dumbfounded look on his face, as if it were obvious. "Of course, my boy! Each attendant shall have their own quarters to rest in for when the day is done. You're my only four passengers, after all, you shall live as my guests, in addition to my protectors." I nod. "Thank you, my lord." Private quarters at night shall make this much easier. The others will be asleep when the time comes. Rali, please watch over me for that night, as I'll ensure your people are remembered by the stars above, the witness to my legacy to be. For the corruption in this king lies unknown to the people of Etrea, I know the truth. Legacy, they say. Legacy... I'll make you remembered.
The meeting comes to an uneventful, short end, as the king becomes tired. It must be truly hard work sitting on a throne and ordering the slaughter of my people, my loved ones. As the other Braves mingle on their way out, I retreat to my chambers hastily, as I have a more important meeting to attend to tonight. Bephalos has some final words for me, "On the night of the last star," is what he told me. I can only assume that means 'right now,' as there won't be stars in our sky for days. I enter my chambers and slam the door shut, locking it behind me. The shadowcaster appears, to no fanfare or grandeur.
"Tavi, you look anxious, friend. Tell me, what is the matter?" Bephalos inquires, as his spell fades. "Surely, you've aware of the procedure tomorrow?" he adds on. "I'm aware, Bephalos. And yes, the blade, I know..." I reply, looking toward the Queensblade with my hand. He's emphasized to me before that this must be the blade to end it, although the reasoning is unclear to me. Perhaps it's some sort of ancient seal? I trust in him, nonetheless. "Very good, Tavi. The day of your revenge is finally dawning upon you. How does it feel? Rali will surely rest better in her tomb, knowing her murderer shall fall with her." The shadowcaster muses, sneering toward me. I grip the blade tightly, then release as I sigh. "...I'd appreciate it if you avoided using her name in such ways. I am doing this for her, but that does not mean I'll allow you to disrespect her, fiend." I glare at the man, staring into his vacant purple eyes. Empty, unshaken by my words. "Oh, so scary! Let's not make enemies with the ally that has granted you such an opportunity now, hm? It's taken me great efforts to procure this blade for you, you know. Without it, the king would surely return!"
The man responds hastily, irritated most likely. "Fine." I reply, calming myself down. Tomorrow is the day... "I want to rest, Bephalos. What do you require of me?" I ask, sitting down on my desk chair as I look up at the shadowcaster. "I simply need to leave one last touch, is all. Quality assurance is one way to put it." He laughs, and I stare blankly. "Very well. Go ahead." The shadowcaster takes the blade and focuses on it intensely. Shadows emit from it briefly, although I'm not knowledgeable on why. Shadowcast is a very rare sight in Etrea, and the know-how of such topics is restricted to only the most elite of scholars to prevent misuse, so I've been told. Although, I've been told a great many deal of things that carry merit no more, as Bephalos has told me the truths of this kingdom. "That is all, then. Rest well, Tavi. You'll need it." Bephalos smiles cheekily as he retreats to the window, before becoming a shade and fading. I look down to the Queensblade once more, listening to it idly hum. "So this is the fate we're making, Rali..." I ponder to myself, placing it on the desk. Without further delay, I retreat to my bedsheets.
The morning of the fated day has come. Bright and early, boarding the 'Brave Hoshi,' so the king says. "Here, here!" A'ras calls out to me from the dock, more excited then he should be. I wave, and approach him. "Take a look at that, Tavi! I've never seen a grander vessel in my life!" He exclaims, pushing me along onto the ship. "Aye, let me take my time, friend." I reply, trying to scope out the surroundings of the 'Brave Hoshi'. I stand upon the central deck, looking around. "Large main deck... private chambers that way... a kitchen of some sort the other way... and..." I mumble to myself, looking around the ship carefully. It seems my best option remains to be confronting the king within his private chambers, lest the others take notice of what's happening. A large hand smacks my shoulder, and as I jump from the startle. "My boy! Isn't it beautiful?" the king speaks, towering over me. "Aye, it is, my lord. Indeed, it is." I sneer, looking off to the chambers. "Say, my lord, which one of these are we occupying? There's seven chambers here, four for us Braves, one for you, one for the chef, and one for the captain.. How do we know which is which?" I ask politely, ensuring I maintain composure.The king walks over to the chambers, and proudly knocks on a large wooden door, taller than the rest. "This here would be mine! If any matters or problems arise, please come see me, no matter the time. You are a part of the Braves, after all." He laughs. "Noted, my lord." I reply, staring at the door intently. How convenient.
We depart from the Etris docks, to a celebrated fanfare. Many Etrean citizens gather around and wave and cheer as we depart, wishing the king a safe journey. As our home fades from the sight of all of us onboard, I'm reminded once more of our city, and what the king has taken from it. Yet they cheer him on... blissfully unaware. Unaware and controlled, all of his people. Bephalos' truth echoes throughout my head as I sit upon the deck, watching the waves of the Etrean waters roll by whilst the day passes. I wait patiently for the arrival of the Voidsea. "This, this is when you strike," Bephalos instructed me during one of our initial meetings. The search for the lighthouse takes priority for all crew members, and for the others it is a time for rest. But for me, it is when the final hour begins.
Upon the arrival of the Voidsea waters, the others become busy or fatigued. I've remained in my place throughout the entire first day of our voyage, watching the waves. I look up at the sky, and just as was foretold, no stars are to be seen.
Hours pass, and Voidsea waters still surround us. The others have retreated to their chambers a long while ago, most perhaps resting by now. I'm ready. I stand up, and ensure my blade is at my side still. I approach the king's chambers, and knock three times. He opens the door, puzzled. Oh, King of Etrea... you're a sorry fool. "We need to speak." I say flatly, staring intently at him. "Of? I have no qualms, my boy. Is something the matter?" He replies, still confused by the sudden request. "Private matters. Please, allow me in." I glare at him.
The door shuts behind me with a loud click, and the king takes his seat. The room is quite luxurious, as expected of this man's vain desires. "Tell me, Tavi, what brings you here?" he asks. That's the first time he's said my name in days. Pathetic. "My lord, I've come to ask you for the truth. I want to know why you did it. I want to know what made you think all of this was okay." I stand over him, looking down at his puzzled expression fiercely. "The truth? Of what? I need more explanation to understand what you speak of, my boy." There it is. 'My boy.' Condescending, even to his last breath. "Rali. The fourth guard of Blade Initiates. The second Driftland Calamity." I speak harshly, leaning closer to him. "Your highness. You have killed hundreds of innocent people, in the name of 'understanding.'" I glare at him. He looks up at me, still puzzled. "Rali? What is that? Driftland.. Huh? I'm afraid I've not been told the knowledge you seek, my boy." He replies. I snap. That was enough.
I slam the desk nearby harshly, watching all of his regal silverware falling off. "You sent her to her death, you fool. You knew that Driftland's time was running short. You knew there were mere days left in its lifespan. Yet you still sent her to her death. You're responsible. She's gone now. Why? Why?" I start speaking faster than I can think, words leaving my mouth at a rapid pace, quicker than I can think over if they should be said. I'm shaking, red in the face, and on the verge of tears. "You did this to her. She's gone now. Why?" I scream at him. He looks at me, trembling and confused. Stop pretending. You know just as well as I what you did, stop pretending you're clueless. "Tavi... I think you're mistaken. Your head must be on loose. The fourth guard of Blade Initiates never participated in that Driftland expedition. They weren't there for the second Driftland Calamity. It's a tragedy, I know, but they simply weren't there, my boy." He shakes his head at me as he speaks, and my heart starts pounding harder. Liar. You think you can claim her life was never taken? You have no right. My people, my fourth guard, we did not lose ourselves for this. "You... you are vile. Vile liar. You sent my people to their deaths. For that, you shall lose your own." I reach for the Queensblade, hearing it hum louder, it sounds as if it were laughing. The king looks to my hand, and realizes what I'm about to do. He quickly gets up, and rushes to the door- it's locked, as per our agreement for our private discussion. As he scrambles for the key, I approach, blade drawn. "The King of Etrea. You are not deserving of this title. You've led my people, my... you lead Rali to her death. This is your penance." I raise my arm, and with all my strength, I slash through him.
A scream echoes throughout the ship. I hear footsteps scrambling across the deck outside. I look down upon the corpse of the liar, and then to my blade. "You... are a fool, Tavi. You have no idea what you've caused with my death. This penance of yours... leads to more death than you could ever imagine. Fate will now steer Etrea in my stead, but now, toward uncertainty..." He coughs violently as he trembles on the floor. The blade laughs, and I stab it into his body one last time, leaving it there as he passes. I shake violently as I realize that it's done. Rali has been avenged, our people are avenged, I've finally done it. I kneel upon the ground and weep tears of joy, knowing our turmoil has finally ended... I can finally be at peace. The people will know what he did, they'll see him as I saw him!
I hear a familiar sound behind me. Shadowcast travel, the same as the previous night. I freeze, and look behind myself, and see Bephalos standing over me. Something feels wrong. "You did a wonderful job, Tavi." He smiles at me, reaching down to the Queensblade and pulling it from the corpse. "Oh, how it's most pleasant to the touch now. The presence of the dead, a presence of great renown." He mutters to himself, brandishing the blade. "You're such a good puppet." He grins, muttering. "What do you... huh?" I stammer, trying to form words as my heart pounds more.
"Rali would be so happy, wouldn't she? The king was responsible for her death, right?" Bephalos asks in a mocking manner. I feel something crawling up my spine. "Yes... that's what you told- happened. That's what happened, yes. That's what I remember, I... don't remember." I can feel tears welling in my eyes. What did I just do? Something feels horribly wrong. This was all for Rali, right? It was the liar's fault she died. It's all I can remember. "Tavi, you're truly a pleasure to work with. Now, I'm going to tell you something important." He crouches down to be at eye-level with me, I'm still trembling on the ground. "Outside that door is a world where five people know you just killed the King of Etrea. They will kill you, Tavi, and the rest of the world will remember you as a vile assassin." I tremble, looking at him with fear in my eyes. What did I just do? This feels wrong. This isn't right. Gods below, I'm a fool. This never was right. "But I can offer you a deal. A way to make things easier for the both of us Tavi. Let me sink this ship within the waste of this Voidsea. Let the truth drown with its crew. And I can bring you somewhere... where no soul shall have to know. I'll bring you to a place where the truth may stay hidden forever. The king is simply lost at sea, they crew is searching for the lighthouse for all of eternity." Bephalos smiles, grabbing my shoulder tightly. "Should you decline, I'll let you go down with the rest of the crew. What do you say?" He mutters quietly, glaring at me with those empty, vacant purple eyes. I look down at the blood on my hands, my legs, the room. I hear banging on the door, as the others have been alerted that something is wrong. Should I stay... I die. Should I go... I die, eventually. This wasn't right, I...
"I'll go to that safe place." I cry out, having given up on this fate. "Very well," the man smiles. He gets up, holstering the Queensblade, then tying a blindfold around his eyes. "Tavi, when you come to your senses there, I wish you the best of luck." Bephalos muses one last time, before turning away from me. I feel a darkness wrapping around myself, an ancient shadowcast art. My consciousness fades out, as an overwhelming weight rests on my mind.
"Rali, forgive me."
